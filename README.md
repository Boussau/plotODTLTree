# R code to plot a species phylogenetic tree decorated with events of gene origination, duplication, transfer, and loss.

It requires a species tree in Newick format (testData/tree.txt), numbers of events on each branch of the species tree (testData/test.txt), and finally another file giving corrections to apply to the gene contents to account for genes that have been lost in all descendant lineages (testdata/test.ext).
